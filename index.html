        <h1>Tech Stack</h1>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have worked extensively with a wide range of languages, frameworks, and tools</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Frontend</li>
          <li>Backend</li>
          <li>Database</li>
          <li>DevOps</li>
          <li>Cloud</li>
          <li>Development Tools</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
        <p>With a strong interest in systems and processes — especially within the fintech space — I bring deep domain
          knowledge, a sharp eye and a go-getter spirit for implementing modern, practical solutions. I believe the best
          solutions are simple, not complex — and I strive to bring that clarity and precision to every project I work
          on.</p>
        <p>I incorporate AI extensively to accelerate my development delivery, but never at the expense of fully
          understanding the technologies, processes and functionalities in place. I do not believe that AI is here to
          replace our professions — but to evolve them instead. As the landscape shifts, I believe that remaining agile
          and adaptable is the key in remaining thriving and relevant.</p>
        <p>Aside from building solutions, some of my hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Motorcycling</li>
          <li>Weightlifting</li>
          <li>Instruments</li>
          <li>Coffee</li>
        </ul>
